# How can the UX of signify match the wishes of the SignalRGB community?

## What is SignalRGB?
SignalRGB is a single piece of software that lets you control and sync your RGB lighting. It's a free application that you can use on Windows. SignalRGB uses a html canvas to draw effects. You can then place your hardware anywhere on this canvas and signalRGB will send the correct color to your hardware. There is also an effect store, in this effect store you can view multiple effects and download them from there.

## What are the main UI properties of SignalRGB?

### Color pallette: 
SignalRGB has a very dark color pallete with some very high saturated gradients sprinkled in. The main color of the application is dark blue with pink and light blue accents. This color pallete is also synced between the desktop application and their website

### General layout:
 SignalRGB has a simple layout with a sidebar on the left and the page content on the right. The website uses a different format, as here the sidebar is on the top and the page content is on the bottom.

Other than this the majority of the homepage is taken up by effect images, which are used to entice the user to download an effect. These effect images are all very saturated and have a lot of color. 

### Responsiveness:
SignalRGB is only slightly responsive. Everything does scale down, but the sidebar will take over the majority of the applcation if you go down to a mobile size. 

### Efficieny:
SignalRGB doesn't have much clutter and only shows the features you will use most. You can go into more depth by clicking on the settings button, but this is not necesarry to use the application.
