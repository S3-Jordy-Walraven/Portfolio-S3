## Setting up a SpringBoot CRUD Api

### Creating application in the spring initializer
  Setting up a basic CRUD api in SpringBoot is very easy. 
  First off navigate to https://start.spring.io
  For this project we will be chosing a Maven project with Java as language
  We will be using spring boot 2.7.4 for this example. Below the version selection fill in a name for you app
  For the java version we will be using the version that has been selected by default in this case java 17.
  
  After setting this up we will be adding the following dependencies:
    -Spring Web
    -Lombok
    -MySql Driver
    -(For now we will not use spring security, but in the future this will be added)
    
  And click generate
