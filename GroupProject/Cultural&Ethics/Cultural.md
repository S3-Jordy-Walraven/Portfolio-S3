# Culture

## What is Culture? 
Culture is a term that is used for a large set of aspects of the social life like:
- Language
- Beliefs
- Practices
- Values
- Norms

Each culture has some kind of accepted way of doing things. This is called the culture of that group. This culture is learned by the members of the group. This means that the culture is not something that is written down in a book. It is something that is learned by the members of the group. This is why it is so important to have a diverse group of people in a group. This way you can learn from each other and make sure that the culture of the group is as diverse as possible. 

When meeting people from other cultures it is important to be aware of the culture of that group. This way you can make sure that you don't offend anybody. For example in some cultures it's normal to be direct or speak louder, while in other cultures this is seen as rude.

## Which are well-known dimensions of culture differences?

### Power distance
This dimension displays how a society deals with the fact that people are unequal. This means that some people have more power than others. In some cultures it is normal to have a lot of power distance. This means that people with more power are seen as better than people with less power. In other cultures it is normal to have a low power distance. This means that people with more power are seen as equals to people with less power.

### Individualism vs Collectivism
This dimension is divided into two parts. Individualism and Collectivism. In individualistic cultures people are seen as individuals. This means that people are responsible for themselves. In collectivistic cultures people are seen as a part of a group. This means that people are responsible for the group. 

### Masculinity vs Femininity
This dimension is divided into two parts. Masculinity and Femininity. In masculine cultures people are seen as more aggressive and competitive. In feminine cultures people are seen as more caring and cooperative.

### Uncertainty avoidance
This dimension displays how a society deals with the fact that the future is uncertain. In some cultures it is normal to avoid uncertainty. This means that people are more likely to follow rules and traditions. In other cultures it is normal to accept uncertainty. This means that people are more likely to try new things and take risks.

### Long-term vs Short-term orientation
This dimension is divided into two parts. Long-term orientation and Short-term orientation. In long-term oriented cultures people are more likely to think about the future. This means that they will avoid short-term pleasures and focus on long-term goals. In short-term oriented cultures people are more likely to think about the present. This means that they will focus on short-term pleasures and avoid long-term goals.

### Indulgence vs Restraint
This dimension is divided into two parts. Indulgence and Restraint. In indulgent cultures people are more likely to enjoy life and are carefree. In restrained cultures people are more likely to avoid things that are seen as bad and are more strict.


## My experience with culture differences
<hr>
This semester the cultural differences within our group are quite small, we have big personality differences, but I will get back to this later. In this group we are all dutch and we all live in the Netherlands. We speak the same Language and are all used to the same norms and values. 

<br>

In semester 1 of previous year I had a class with people from all over the world. I saw all kinds of difference in culture here. For example when someone from bulgaria had his birthday he would give everyone a small snack. 
There was also a small language gap. Most people spoke english very well, but some people had some extreme accents making it harder to understand. You would also see that there were some cultures where people were more direct, while others would tell a story before they would get to the point. 

<br>

Because of all these cultural differences you learn to work together in a different way. You learn to be more open to other cultures and you learn to be more aware of the differences. This way you can make sure that you don't offend anybody and that you can work together in a good way.

## My experience with personality differences
<hr>
In this group we have all kinds of personalities. One thing that we all have in common is that the whole group is quite introverted and not very outspoken. This means that we all hate presenting in front of the product owner. People in the group also tend to work in different ways, some people only get motivated to do something when there is a hard deadline, while others will get straight to work when they receive a task.

Some people in the group also stay calm no mather what, while I can get quite stressed when something isn't finished or have to do a presentation. We also have some people in our group that even work on their tasks after school, while others only work on their tasks when they are at school.

## What did I do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences? 
<hr>
What I did to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences is that I tried to be more open to other cultures. I tried to be more aware of the differences and I tried to make sure that I didn't offend anybody. I also tried to make sure that I didn't make any assumptions about other cultures. Also when someone from a different culture would say something that I think is rude, I would try to understand why they said it and why they think it's okay.
