Scrum is a way of working that is based on the idea that you should be able to adapt to changes in the project.  This is done by making a backlog for the project and then making a plan for the next sprint every couple of weeks. This way you can adapt to changes in the project.

### Scrum Board
To keep track of the tasks that need to be completed we use a scrum board. On this scrumboard each group member can see what they need to do and the state of the task(Not done ,in-progress, done). We use Jira for our scrum board.


### Sprint planning

The Sprint planning is the event that is being held at the start of a sprint. The Sprint planning is the event where the team plans the sprint. The team will look at the backlog and they will decide what they will do in the next sprint. This is the event where the team will decide what they will do in the sprint and how they will do it.

### Stand-Up/ Stand-Down
The Stand-Up is an event that happens at the begining of the day. During the standup each group members talks about what their plans are for the day and what they excpect to get done. They also talk about possible issues they might run into or need help with. At the end of the day group members will do a stand-down. During the stand-down each group member talks about what they did that day and issues they might've run into. They will also give a rough estimation of what they plan to do the next day.

### Sprint Review
The Sprint Review is the event that is being held at the end of a sprint. The Sprint Review is the event where the team will show the product to the Product Owner. The Product Owner will look at the product and give feedback on the product. The Product Owner will also decide whether the user stories are done or not.
During the review the product owner will also decide what the team will do in the next sprint.
