## What is Jira?
Jira is a project management tool that is used to keep track of tasks and issues. Jira is used to keep track of tasks and issues. This is done by making a backlog for the project and then making a plan for the next sprint every couple of weeks. This way you can adapt to changes in the project.


## User Stories
In Jira we use user stories to keep track of the tasks that need to be done. A user story is a short description of a feature that needs to be implemented. Each User Story has multiple sub Issues. This way we can assign a person to a sub issue and keep track of the progress of the user story.

## Progress
In Jira you can also easily keep track of the progress during the project. This is done by asigning story points to a user story. This way you can get an estimate of how much work a certain task is. Jira can also generate a velocity graph based on this. In this velocity graph you can see how many user points have been completed during a certain sprint.
