# Agile within our group

## Scrum
Within our own project we use Scrum. Scrum is a way of working that is based on the idea that you should be able to adapt to changes in the project. To get more information about this check out this [file](Scrum.md).

Now let's talk about my personal experience with Scrum and the things that I like and dislike about it.

### How we used the different roles within scrum
In our group we have a product owner, a scrum master and a development team. Our product owner is Mediaan, and our scrum master is not determined. With this I mean that every sprint we have a different person that is the scrum master. This is done to make sure that everyone in the group gets a chance to be the scrum master. 

### Sprints
In our group we have 3 week sprints. At the end of each sprint we have a sprint review, where we present the work that we have done. After this we have a sprint retrospective, where we talk about what went well and what didn't go well. During our retrospective we have used a multiple methods, 

### Standup
Every thursday during our standup we talk about what everybody has done, and we split the tasks for the next week. This way we can make sure that everybody is on the same page. During this standup people also talk about the issues they are facing and if they can solve them theirselves. If not they can ask someone else on the team for help.

### Sprint Review
During the sprint review we present the work that we have done during the sprint. We decided at the start that this is done by 1 different person each week. This way we can make sure that everybody gets a chance to present. After the presentation we have a Q&A session where the product owner can ask questions about the work that we have done. And give us the new user stories for the next sprint. During our second and fourth sprint the product owner expected us to have more work finished. So he gave us more tasks for the next sprint. We didn't argue with this, because we knew that we weren't in optimal state, but the tasks he gave us might be too much for the next sprint. 

### Sprint Retrospective
During the sprint review we look back at what has happened the last sprint and discuss how it went. We have used multiple methods during the retrospectives. We have used methods like What went well, What can be improved and What needs to stop. We try to keep the retrospectives positive, but sometimes we also have to talk about stuff that can be improved or the progress of an individual. During this retrospective we try to help the people that are struggling with their tasks, and try to help them or make the task more clear. We also discuss the feedback we get from the product owners. 

### The points we have improved by using the feedback from the retrospective
The points that we have improved by using the feedback from the retrospective are task management and communication. In the first sprint we had a lot of problems with task management, as people didn't do their tasks. This caused us to have a bad presentation to the product owner. After this we decided to improve our task management, and we have seen a major improvement in this. The team communication is way better, and task management is way more even. This had as result that sprint 3 went way better than the first 2 sprints.
