# Agile within our group

## Scrum
Within our own project we use Scrum. Scrum is a way of working that is based on the idea that you should be able to adapt to changes in the project. To get more information about this check out this [file](Scrum.md).

Now let's talk about my personal experience with Scrum and the things that I like and dislike about it.

### How we used the different roles within scrum
In our group we have a product owner, a scrum master and a development team. Our product owner is Mediaan, and our scrum master is not determined. With this I mean that every sprint we have a different person that is the scrum master. This is done to make sure that everyone in the group gets a chance to be the scrum master. 

### Sprints
In our group we have 3 week sprints. At the end of each sprint we have a sprint review, where we present the work that we have done. After this we have a sprint retrospective, where we talk about what went well and what didn't go well. During our retrospective we have used a multiple methods, 

For our first sprint retrospective we used a method where each team member wrote down what they thought went well and what didn't go well. After this we discussed these points, and made a list of things that we could improve. In our case this was especially task management. 

For our third sprint we had a retrospective where we wrote down what we should start doing, stop doing and continue doing. We did this by having each team member suggest some points, and after this we discussed if the rest of the team also thought the same thing about these points.

### The points we have improved by using the feedback from the retrospective
The points that we have improved by using the feedback from the retrospective are task management and communication. In the first sprint we had a lot of problems with task management, as people didn't do their tasks. This caused us to have a bad presentation to the product owner. After this we decided to improve our task management, and we have seen a major improvement in this. The team communication is way better, and task management is way more even. This had as result that sprint 3 went way better than the first 2 sprints.
