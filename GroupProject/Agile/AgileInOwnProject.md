# Agile within our group

## Scrum
Within our own project we use Scrum. Scrum is a way of working that is based on the idea that you should be able to adapt to changes in the project. To get more information about this check out this [file](Scrum.md).

Now let's talk about my personal experience with Scrum and the things that I like and dislike about it.

### What I like about Scrum
As I have progressed to the project I started liking working in sprints a whole lot. I like sprints, because they divide up the work into smaller chunks, instead of getting overwhelmed by the whole project. I also like the Scrum board, especially in Jira. As Jira gives a clear overview of what subTasks need to be done, and what has already happened. You can find more about how we use Jira in the project [here](Jira.md).

Another thing that I like about Scrum is the stand-up. I like the stand-up, and stand-down, as this makes it easy to see if people are really doing their tasks. And if this is not the case like I have experienced multiple times this project, you can confront someone about it. In general Scrum makes it easier to confront people about their work, and get a great sense of what people are actually doing.

Something I also really like is that Scrum is very organized. This means that people will complete their task, without deviating from the plan. In semester 2 we didn't optimally use scrum, and this caused the team to be side tracked by less important tasks. 

### What I dislike about Scrum
The thing I dislike about Scrum is that you are very dependent on the product owner and your teammates. If you have a bad product owner, or teammates that don't do their work, you will have a bad time. In the first couple of sprints I have had some bad experiences with this. As the first sprint not everyone was doing what was promissed. This caused us to give a bad presentation to the product owner. For example we wanted to make Wireframes and design the first sprint, and we assigned some people to this task, but they didnt work on this. This caused us to work on the application without a real design, which resulted in a pretty lackluster frontend. After feedback from the product owner we decided to rework the frontend, but this only happened in sprint 3. 

### How we used the different roles within scrum
In our group we have a product owner, a scrum master and a development team. Our product owner is Mediaan, and our scrum master is not determined. With this I mean that every sprint we have a different person that is the scrum master. This is done to make sure that everyone in the group gets a chance to be the scrum master. 

### Sprints
In our group we have 3 week sprints. At the end of each sprint we have a sprint review, where we present the work that we have done. After this we have a sprint retrospective, where we talk about what went well and what didn't go well. During our retrospective we have used a multiple methods, 

For our first sprint retrospective we used a method where each team member wrote down what they thought went well and what didn't go well. After this we discussed these points, and made a list of things that we could improve. In our case this was especially task management. 

For our third sprint we had a retrospective where we wrote down what we should start doing, stop doing and continue doing. We did this by having each team member suggest some points, and after this we discussed if the rest of the team also thought the same thing about these points.

### The points we have improved by using the feedback from the retrospective
The points that we have improved by using the feedback from the retrospective are task management and communication. In the first sprint we had a lot of problems with task management, as people didn't do their tasks. This caused us to have a bad presentation to the product owner. After this we decided to improve our task management, and we have seen a major improvement in this. The team communication is way better, and task management is way more even. This had as result that sprint 3 went way better than the first 2 sprints.
